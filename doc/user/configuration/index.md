# Configuration

Allay can be configured via a `allay.toml` file placed in the root directory of your site. This file allows you to set various parameters that control the behavior and appearance of your site.

The configuration file is global and affects the entire site.

Available configuration options include:

- `baseUrl`: The base URL of your site. This is useful if your site is hosted in a subdirectory.
- `title`: The title of your site.
- `theme`: The theme to use for your site.
- `params`: A table of custom parameters that can be accessed in your templates.
